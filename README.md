DIY hardware controller for emulating volume manipulations of Windows Mixer (sndvol.exe) and some prefered applications (Discord\Spotify\etc.)

Currently in initall state of development - trying out Windows APIs, creating simple Arduino logic and so on... 
Discord/Spotify integration is in a far distant future :/
